            parts,
            bills of materials, employee information, invoices, purchase orders or other files the user may
            upload via
            the software application.</p>
        <p>2.2. Fraction ERP assumes no responsibility for the correctness, completeness or quality of the
            information
            provided or stored. In particular, Fraction ERP gives no guarantee of the availability of
            information.</p>
        <p>2.3. Fraction ERP offers a platform that allows users to manage business processes typically used by
            manufacturing, assembly and warehousing/distribution companies. It also allows information to be
            shared
            within your organisation and with its users. Fraction ERP takes no responsibility for the content
            involved
            in the communication between users or the content or information uploaded by users of the system.
            The users
            are responsible for the execution and responsible use of the system amongst themselves within the
            organisation. Fraction ERP takes no responsibility for any data used in its application or
            activities that
            may result in any harm or otherwise to personnel, staff, visitors, equipment and assets. There is no
            guarantee of safe working practises, risk assessments, correct or appropriate schedules to meet with
            any
            legislation or particular requirements of the organisation using the application. Fraction ERP is
            not
            responsible for any losses as a result of the information, communication or instructions provided
            through
            use of its Services.</p>
        <p><strong>3. REGISTRATION AND TRUTHFULNESS</strong></p>

            validity
            of any of the remaining clauses or remaining parts of these clauses.</p>
        <p>12.2. An invalid provision must be substituted by the involved parties with a clause that fulfils the

            reason. If the
