          <p><b>ERP implementation</b> can be daunting to many of us. This is especially true if this is your first
            ERP implementation. We realise that there are enough horror stories out there that can put you
            off...<BR><BR>

            However, it doesn't have to be difficult. We built Fraction ERP so that the <b>implementation is
              straightforward</b>. So, if you have a long list of reservations about changing your ERP system, or
            concerned about moving away from spreadsheets, this guide is for you.<BR> <BR>

            Our free ERP implementation guide provides solid generic information to help you with your decision
            making. You can use the advice regardless of the system you have or choose to move to. From selection of
            an ERP system, to deployment and mastery, our guide is short and practical. <BR> <BR>

            We've seen enough painful ERP implementations take place and witness system deployments that were
            sub-optimal. <a href="https://fractionerp.com/about"><b>We've learned from all these mistakes</b></a> so
            you don't have to! This guide can help you avoid the common pitfalls. <BR> <BR>

                software</b></a>. This guide will help you get the results you need from your system quicker and
            with less time and cost on your part. <BR> <BR>
