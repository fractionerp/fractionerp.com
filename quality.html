      <h4>Supports ISO 9001</h4>
      <p>Fraction ERP supports the requirements of the ISO 9001 Quality Management Systems standard. Capture
        important production records that are needed to demonstrate a fully functional and compliant system. Record
        opportunities for improvement via our notes system and manage non-conforming products all within our cloud
        ERP system.</p>
      <h4>Non conformance reporting</h4>
      <p>Raise Non Conformance Reports (NCRs) from any works order. Just click on the works order and log the
        issues. Manage and close out your NCRs using our easy to navigate NCR system. There is even a dashboard tile
        dedicated to managing this function.</p>

      <h4> Get to the root cause</h4>
      <p>At Fraction ERP we know how powerful the 5 Why method can be, to determine root causes. Our NCR template is
        structured to help you identify the true root cause and eliminate problems once and for all.</p>
      <h4> Raise corrective actions</h4>
      <p>When you have determined the true root cause, you need to do something about it. Fraction ERP allows you to
        create corrective action tasks for your NCRs. Assign the tasks to your team and manage the improvement
        process in one place. With only a few clicks you can demonstrate the close out of tasks to customers and
        external auditors.</p>

      <h4> Role based permissions to manage NCRs</h4>
      <p>Our fast user setup screens allow you control the permissions your team have within Fraction ERP. One of
        these settings is related to NCR management. Maintain control over who has authority and responsibility in
        your business to assign and manage the NCR process.</p>
      <h4> Track quality costs</h4>
      <p>Capture the various costs that are associated with the cost of quality. Fraction ERP allows you to capture
        as much, or as little, information as you want. Cost headings include scrap, replacement, rework, subcon,
        transport and overhead. Getting visibility of these factors can help you to drive down the cost of expensive
        rework and reduce customer complaints.</p>
      <h4>Monitor supplier non conformance</h4>
      <p>Codify your supplier NCRs and monitor their performance. Make life easier when it comes to monitoring and
        managing your supply chain.</p>

      <h4>Goods inwards inspection</h4>
      <p>If you have products that need to be checked before they are allowed into production, then activate the
        goods inward inspection process. Set on a part-by-part basis, this process allows you to prevent stock being
        accidentally booked in without first being checked.</p>
      <h4>Export reports to Excel</h4>
      <p>Should you need to carry out further analysis of your non-conformances, you can quickly export your data
        into spreadsheet format. Continue your analysis using the powerful features of your favourite spreadsheet
        software.</p>
