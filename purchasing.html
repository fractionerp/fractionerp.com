        <h4>Purchasing demand made clear</h4>
        <p>With Fraction ERP you can drive your purchasing decisions from the MRP page. Each works order creates
          demand within the MRP system if stock is not readily available. Use this information to speed up your buying
          process.</p>
        <h4>Avoid running out of stock</h4>
        <p>Set inventory level alerts for your critical items and use our stock alerts function to purchase what you
          need, when you need it.</p>
        <h4>Minimum order quantities and pack sizes</h4>
        <p>To help with your buying process, Fraction ERP allows you to configure your items for real world
          purchasing. Minimum order quantities ensure that you aren't buying the same item four times every week. Pack
          sizes allow for easy purchasing e.g. one box of fifty screws can be bought as one box that puts fifty screws
          into stock.</p>
        <h4>Schedule deliveries</h4>
        <p>Works orders informs you when your purchase orders need to arrive at your business. The purchase order can
          be amended to suit your needs.</p>
        <h4>Multi-currency</h4>
        <p>If your suppliers operate with a different currency, no problem. Set up your suppliers with their default
          currency and let Fraction ERP do the rest.</p>
        <h4>Manage supplier contacts</h4>
        <p>Quickly add new suppliers and their team's details to Fraction ERP. With just a minimum of information you
          can be purchasing from them in minutes.</p>
        <h4>Purchase order approvals</h4>
        <p>Ensure only the right purchase orders are placed using our approval workflow. Based on user privileges,
          only authorised users can approve purchase orders so that they can be placed with suppliers.</p>
        <h4>Late line item alerts on the dashboard</h4>
        <p>Keep your finger on the pulse by knowing exactly what purchase order lines are running late. Click on the
          dashboard and get an immediate drill down on what needs to be chased up.</p>
        <h4>Direct email purchase orders to suppliers </h4>
        <p>Once a purchase order has been approved you can email it directly from Fraction ERP. Edit the email if you
          require and press send. PDF purchase orders can be downloaded, or printed, if a more traditional approach is
          required.</p>
        <h4>Transfer GRNs to your accounting software </h4>
        <p>With our cloud integration to several popular cloud accounting packages, Fraction ERP can push your Goods
          Received Notes (GRNs) across. Manage your debtor list from your accounting software without having to enter
          data twice.</p>
        <h4>Print part labels at goods received</h4>
        <p>If you need to produce labels for your stock items, then Fraction ERP has you covered.</p>
