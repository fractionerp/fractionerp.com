        <h2>What is an MRP System?</h2>

        <div class="container col-lg-10 lg-offset-1">
          <p>
            MRP (Material Resource Planning) is a system to manage the material requirements for a production
            environment used by manufacturing companies.
            The system evaluates current and required stock levels along with the production schedule
            to optimise when items should be purchased and deliveries scheduled.
          <p>

            An MRP system can be run a variety of ways such as paper, spreadsheets or software. Often MRP can become
            very complex and it is easy to miss some items, so it is generally accepted that using <a
              href="mrp-software">MRP Software</a> is the best solution.

        <h3>How Does an MRP System Work?</h3>
        <p class="fst-italic">
          The backbone of manufacturing is the <a href="bill-of-materials">Bill of Materials</a> (BOM) which defines
          which parts or raw materials are required to make each of your products. When a production order is
          raised, either for <b>make to stock</b> or <b>make to order</b>, the requirements from the bill of
          materials is used to create the production demand. </p>
        <p>
          Alongside the current production demand, a company may carry inventory which could satisfy some or all
          production demand requirements. This is the first consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly the MRP system should also account for any items already on back order which may arrive in time
          for production. </p>
        <p>
          Finally the MRP system will consider minimum stock levels over time and ensure that stock does not fall
          below the minimum stock levels. The sophistication of the MRP "engine" will determine how well it performs
          each of these tasks and how well it can optimise the purchasing of materials and parts.
