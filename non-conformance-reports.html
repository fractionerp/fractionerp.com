      <h4>Complete NCR Management</h4>
      <p>Fraction ERP provides a comprehensive non-conformance reporting system that helps you identify, track and resolve quality issues. Raise NCRs directly from works orders and manage them through to completion with full traceability.</p>

      <h4>Root Cause Analysis with 5 Why Method</h4>
      <p>Get to the true root cause of quality issues using our built-in 5 Why methodology. The structured approach helps your team dig deeper and identify the underlying causes of non-conformances, not just the symptoms.</p>

      <h4>Corrective Action Tracking</h4>
      <p>Create and assign corrective action tasks directly from your NCRs. Track progress, set due dates and ensure accountability across your team. Close out actions with documented evidence for audit purposes.</p>

      <h4>Quality Cost Tracking</h4>
      <p>Capture the true cost of quality issues including scrap, rework, replacement parts, subcontractor costs and transport. Visibility of these costs helps drive continuous improvement and reduce waste.</p>

      <h4>Supplier NCR Management</h4>
      <p>Track non-conformances against your suppliers to monitor their quality performance. Build a comprehensive picture of supplier reliability to support your supply chain management decisions.</p>

      <h4>Dashboard Integration</h4>
      <p>Open NCRs appear on your main dashboard so nothing falls through the cracks. At a glance visibility ensures quality issues are addressed promptly and effectively.</p>

      <h4>Supports ISO 9001 Compliance</h4>
      <p>Our NCR system is designed to support the requirements of ISO 9001 Quality Management Systems. Maintain the documented records you need to demonstrate a fully functional and compliant quality system.</p>
