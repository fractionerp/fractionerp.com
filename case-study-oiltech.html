              <h3>Make to order precision engineered parts and assemblies.</h3>
              <p class="">
                <a href="https://oiltechbrg.com" target="new">Oiltech Bearings</a> is a small business, which
                started in 2018. It is a make-to-order business as well as service centre for aftermarket repairs.
                It's products are used in industrial rotating equipment such as pumps, turbines and compressors.
                It's clients are principally in industries supplying equipment to oil and gas, utilities,
                petrochemical and power generation.
                <br>
                It manages a large number of parts and is constantly adding new parts to the BOM register. Typically
                lead times are just a few weeks with emergency work sometimes within a few days. Some of the key
                requirements for Oiltech are below.

                <h4>QUICK RESPONSE</h4>
                <p>Quick turnaround on enquiries is essential at Oiltech Bearings. Having tools such a copy a Bill
                  of Materials and BOM templates allows both the cost estimate and most of the production planning
                  to be completed from the very start of the enquiry. This preparation allows orders to be executes
                  extremely quickly.</p>

                <h4>DON'T MISS ANYTHING</h4>
                <p>It is all too easy to allow a simple fastener to delay production and even shipping of complex
                  assemblies with many parts. Even as a small business, there are hundreds or even thousands of
                  individual requirements each year to be managed. Visual management and dashboards are key to
                  making it easy to stop of top of all requirements. </p>

                <h4>SCHEDULING</h4>
                <p>Scheduling production can be constrained by the workcentre capacity, but sometimes there are jobs
                  that particular skills needed so Oiltech needs to schedule with both operator and workcentre as a
                  constraint.
                  Even as a small business with a handfull of operators, scheduling is important to meet the
                  delivery schedule.

                <h4>LEAN & INTEGRATED</h4>
                <p>Oiltech is a very lean operation. Everything from sales, purchasing, production, shipping and
                  finance is run without any office based staff. Fraction ERP connects the entire team to perform
                  all the requirements of the business as needed. Integration with Xero makes accounting efficient
                  and easy to manage. <br>

              <h3>Cloud Reliability and Mobility</h3>
              <p class="">
                Oiltech bearings does not have any on premise servers. Cloud software and storage is essential as a
                small business to achieve reliability and accessibility without the up front investment. Oiltech
                bearings uses tablets in production to track works orders and enable access to drawings. Some
                production orders are concurrent with design activities. Orders can be started and final
                requirements updated with approved designs and required operations by updating the works orders.
                <br>
                Mobility is essential for Oiltech Bearings. As a small team each member wears several hats and with
                many international clients, significant time is spent overseas. The cloud deployment means the team
                works together regardless of where they are are in the world.
