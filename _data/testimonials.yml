- quote: "Moving over to Fraction was the best decision we could have made. It was a breath of fresh air to go from a convoluted and clunky system to such a slick and user friendly one. From setting up customer and supplier records right through to raising an invoice the process is simple, yet all of the information is there and easy to find. Even making changes is simple, when, in the past with other systems, it has either been impossible or very long winded. The support that we are given is second to none, the team are more than happy to listen to feedback and have made a few tweaks that have made our lives even easier. I would recommend Fraction 100% to any business."

- quote: "Fraction ERP has helped us to move away from our clunky spreadsheets into a more effective way of working. Data is now at our fingertips and is presented in a very clear and visual way. The system is easy to learn and we were able to implement Fraction a bit at a time. Our Indian office can access the information at the same time as our UK team, making our life a lot easier."
