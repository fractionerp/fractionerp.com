In **[Fraction ERP](https://fractionerp.com/)**, we use the BOM Module to capture the components, the manufacturing route and costing information.


This approach makes it quick to update the manufacturing information you need for your products whilst keeping everything in a simple to manage environment. The job costing function builds automatically as you add components and change the manufacturing operations information (including setup time, run time per part and workcentre costs).


The video below gives you a run through of the main system and includes the 'BOM from template' option too.
