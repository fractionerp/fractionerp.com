If your purchasing team currently have to send out Request For Quotations (RFQs) manually, then Fraction ERP's RFQ process might be just what you are looking for.


Integrated into our purchasing module and MRP screen, raising a RFQ is completed in just a few clicks.

**Raising an RFQ can be completed directly from the MRP screen**

When you create the RFQ, you can amend the draft document and then send it directly to your supplier from Fraction ERP (to their email inbox).




After you have received the quotes back from your supply chain you can simply convert the best quote into a purchase order and place the order. The other quotes are then automatically marked as closed.

**Converting a RFQ to a purchase order closes down the other enquiries automatically**

Then the purchase order can be finalised, approved (by the user with the necessary permissions) and issued directly from Fraction ERP.
