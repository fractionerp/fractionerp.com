If you have been through a failed [**ERP implementation**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-implementation-guide.php), or have heard some of the 'horror' stories then read this article.


Implementing ERP can be a relatively straightforward experience, especially when you choose a simple to operate system like Fraction ERP :)


So, let us run through these five traps in order for you to make sure your (next) implementation plan is less painful.

## Trap #1 - Going with the crowd



When you select an ERP system to fit the needs of your business, avoid going with the crowd.


Now, unless you have done this, this might seem a little odd to say this. After all, you're surely your own person.


Well, you'd be surprised at how many people we've spoken to over the years have selected an ERP system purely because someone else is using it! Word of mouth is great but at least evaluate the software yourself, against your own criteria.


This is one of the reasons that we offer a [**free two week trial**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo), so your team can properly play with it and see if the fit is good.


Don't go with the crowd. Get recommendations and then test them with the way that you work.

## Trap #2 - Skimping on training



If you've read any of the Oli Wight books from the 1980s (a pioneer of MRP II systems), you'll know that back then training was one of the main issues for ERP implementation failure. Sadly, forty years on, nothing has changed.


So, two main options exist here:


1. Suck it up and ensure that you have a budget for training and the time put to one side.
2. Find a [**simple ERP system **](https://fractionerp.com/index)that doesn't need as much training.


We've developed Fraction ERP to fall into the second camp - a system that needs very little training.


In fact, we have a [**full support site**](https://support.fractionerp.com/) that allows teams to self onboard (and one of the reasons that we can keep our costs low).


If you want to see how simple the system is, check out the full walkthrough video here:

## Trap #3 - Not defining your SOPs



SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) can be a life saver when it comes to running a business generally. It is no different when it comes to running an ERP system.


Too many businesses get through their training phase, start their implementation and then let everyone do their own thing, hoping for the best. Failing to agree the 'one best way' is a recipe for disaster.


Agreeing with your teams on the best way to use the system and then making that clear to everyone is the way forward here. Or, tell them, but you'll know where your teams are at in terms of this conversation.


This doesn't have to be difficult. An online SOP recording system, or a simple document that defines your policy around how you want to use your ERP system is enough.


Just don't miss this step out as you grow!

**Define the rules for your system and share them with your team**

## Trap #4 - Tolerating loose ends



When you first get your ERP system it is clean, neat and a dream (if you pick the right one of you, of course!). Roll on several months and you can find your system clogged up with old orders, incomplete data and, well, a mess.


Too much of this and your team might try to find alternative ways of working (spreadsheets, apps etc...).


This ties in with having a [**simple to use ERP system**](https://fractionerp.com/index) but defining your housekeeping routine is easily one of the least sexy things you can talk about when it comes to ERP systems. However, it is also one of the most useful things to talk about if you want an efficient and effective ERP system.


So, figure out who needs to look after which bit of your system and keep it clean and tidy.

## Trap #5 - Fighting the system



We see lots of companies resisting ERP systems because the ERP system doesn't work quite the same way that they are used to. This leads to bypassing parts of the system and eventually resenting / avoiding using the ERP system.


Now, choosing the right ERP system for you can take a lot of the pain out of this trap. Being flexible with your approach to working is another option. Doing both is best. Here are some thoughts:


- There is a good chance that your ERP provider cannot tailor your system to work exactly the way that you want it to (especially if it is a cloud product).
- The workflows in the ERP system are probably there for a reason and often make a lot of sense. It is a good idea to find out their logic before you fight them.
- Suggesting improvements is often a way forward, so you eventually meet somewhere in the middle.


Again, choosing an ERP system that is a good fit for you is the best strategy in all of this.
