One of the repeat questions we hear during demos is 'why should I use the shop floor tracking tools?'.


If you have ever spent time walking around your factory to find out where production are up to with your order book, then you'll have a feel for the answer...


...shop floor tracking tools help you to free up time so that you can do more useful things.


We're not saying that finding out where you are isn't important, but doing it efficiently is key to using your time effectively.

## Using your time differently



How many improvement projects could you straighten out and close out, if only you had the time?


What would your internal training be like, if only you had the time to organise?


How much extra business could you take on, if only you had the time to catch up with your customers like you know you should?


There will be more answers, and you'll know the ones that are relevant to you and your business.


The key point is this, shop floor tracking tools can help you to re-direct your time into more useful activities.


## Free shop floor data capture



We don't want our customers to choose between having these tools, or not. Many other ERP providers will charge an additional fee for adding shop floor users onto the system, to record actual progress with work orders. We don't.


We include unlimited shop floor users with our paid subscriptions, so bring your teams into Fraction from day one for no additional cost.


There are a couple of ways that you can start the real time tracking of production orders in Fraction ERP, but one of the best ways is via the 'work to list', see image below.
