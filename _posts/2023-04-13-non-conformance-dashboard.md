[**Non conformance dashboards**](https://fractionerp.com/quality) can really help a manufacturing team to improve and develop their processes. At the heart of every quality management system, non conformances can revolutionise the results you can achieve.


There are some common issues around non conformances and non conformance dashboards that we think we have addressed in Fraction ERP.




---



## 1. Non conformances are separate from the ERP system



Not here at Fraction ERP! We've built non conformance reporting (NCR) directly into Fraction ERP. From the Quality menu, you can dive right into the NCR register, which leads to the next point.

## 2. NCRs are difficult to raise



In Fraction ERP you can raise NCRs from different places, reducing the need to hunt down a form when you need it!


In the screenshots below you can see how NCRs are raised from [**works orders**](https://fractionerp.com/works-orders) and via the [**production tracking**](https://fractionerp.com/shop-floor-data-capture) screen.

## 3. NCRs don't get to the root cause



We recognise this from our own experience with NCRs, not even factoring in an ERP system! In our experience, most non conformances are given a light review and you know that you are then waiting for the same basic issue to surface again...


We're fans for the 5 why method to dig under the skin of a problem. We like it so much we've built it into Fraction ERP's NCR page. Using this approach, you have a better chance of dealing with the real issue and not putting a sticking plaster over the issue.

## 4. Lack of a visible NCR action log



Identifying the root cause is one thing. What about the corrective actions?


This feature is part of Fraction ERP too. Assign actions from the NCR report and then manage them via their own corrective action log.

---



## 5. Poor action tracking - no non conformance dashboard!



To help tie the corrective actions into a regular management approach, we've included open NCRs on our dashboard. The dashboard is the first thing you see when you open Fraction ERP. If you run a sunrise meeting approach, or daily production meeting, clicking on the 'open NCRs' tile will take you straight through to a list of the open non conformances. Simple.
