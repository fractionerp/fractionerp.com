What is the best way to explore an ERP system and find out if it is a good fit for your business?


We think that using the system is one of the top ways you can do this.


Of course, you can read reviews and ask your colleagues, suppliers and customers if they would recommend anything. Those options work well.


But, in our opinion, nothing beats [**taking an ERP system for a test drive**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo) and putting it through its paces. Most of us test drive a car before we buy it, even if we've been told its the best car on the road.

## Online demo and two week trial



We designed Fraction ERP so that you can take a [**free two week trial**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo) and do exactly this. Put some test orders through the system, let your staff play with the [**graphical scheduler**](https://fractionerp.com/blog/new-drag-and-drop-scheduling) and delve into the order management tools.


We offer a short online demo to give you a feel for the system and ideally show you some of the features that will help you the most. We've built Fraction ERP so that it is flexible and you can use it in a way that best suits you. But, after the demo is done, nothing beats actually playing with the system.

## Your list of requirements



So, what are you comparing your experience of an ERP system to?


Do you have a list of 'must have' and 'want to have' features that your ERP system ideally is able to deliver?


Drawing up this list makes evaluating an ERP system far easier. You can see the bulk of Fraction ERP's features on our [**features page**](https://fractionerp.com/features).


Knowing exactly what you want makes testing an ERP system so much clearer; you know what you are looking for.

## Next steps



Hopefully this short article has convinced you to look into an [**ERP trial**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo) when you need to evaluate ERP systems.


Getting feedback from your team about what is better and what is worse, compared to your existing system / approach, is invaluable. I'm sure you'll take some feedback with a pinch of salt, but feedback from the people that will be using it makes the selection process easier and improves buy in once you come to implementation.


Regarding implementation, we've made Fraction ERP as simple as possible to make implementation quick and painless. To back up this claim, we don't charge for support to deploy the system as our customers deploy it themselves. We have a [**full support site**](https://support.fractionerp.com/) which includes step by step guides on how to use the various parts of the system.


If you want to take the next step and [**arrange an online demo**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo), fill in the form below and we can give you a quick tour of our cloud ERP system before you start a free two week trial to test out the system.
