Do you wish that you could reduce the amount of administrative work your team have to do, to get production out of the door?


Who doesn't?


That's why we focused Fraction ERP on being a [**simple ERP system**](https://fractionerp.com/).

## What is simple ERP?



This is more of a search term, and a wish, than a category.


A simple ERP system is simply one that is less complex, and less complicated, when compared to other options available in the market.


Or, put another way, fewer screens, fewer options, fewer clicks and less training time. That's a good summary of a simple ERP system.


We've designed Fraction ERP to be a simple ERP system.

## Reduce the admin



So, if you can reduce the amount of effort required, the time required, you can start to work on re-directing that resource elsewhere. What could you achieve if you could spend less time on admin and more time on serving your customers?


ERP systems are meant to be productivity tools. For too many businesses, when you choose the wrong system (one that doesn't fit with your business) they can become a shackle.


If you are new to ERP systems, and perhaps looking for your first system, keep the simple ERP idea in your mind. You don't have to have the most complicated, and most expensive, system to get results. Avoiding duplication of data entry and speeding up administrative tasks should happen whatever system you go for.
