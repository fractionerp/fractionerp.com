Are you looking for a new [**ERP system**](https://fractionerp.com/) and are wary of engaging with a company to have a demo?


An [**ERP demo**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo) is a critical part of the assessment, for a number of reasons that I'll go into in a moment.


This short article aims to do two things. Firstly, go over the benefits of getting your sleeves rolled up when it comes to an ERP demo. Secondly, why the team at Fraction ERP are [**nice people**](https://fractionerp.com/about) and how we barely do sales(!).

## The benefits of an ERP demo

### Find the features



Hopefully you've got a good idea of the [**features of an ERP system**](https://fractionerp.com/features) from their website (ours included!).


What if you haven't seen some of the really cool things that makes an ERP system stand out from the crowd?


There is a good chance that you haven't absorbed everything from the website, so the ERP demo is a pivotal moment where you get to see all of the features that are important to you and your business.

### See if it works



Will the ERP system you are reviewing handle your products and your production?


If you arrange an ERP demo you should be able to see for yourself.


If it lines up with your requirements, great. If it doesn't, well that's another frog kissed!

### See what the support team are like



Sales pitches are one thing...


During an ERP demo you should be able to get a feel for who you'll be working with from the ERP vendor's team.


If you like them and think that you can work with them, your implementation might just work!




---



### Team feedback



Of course, hearing the feedback from your team is invaluable.


Unless you are going to carry out all of the administrative and planning operations of an ERP system, it is a good idea to get a view from across the team. Don't get lost in debate, but a pinch of useful feedback is worth its weight in gold.


There is no point thinking that you have found the ideal system and then realising that it doesn't fit your purchasing teams' needs!

## What about Fraction ERP's team?



How do we make this process easier?


Firstly, we're all engineers. Not a professional sales person in sight!


What does this mean. In short, we're nerds and are more interested in finding the right fit for an enquiry than just flogging software.


We'd love it if Fraction ERP fitted your business like a glove, but reality says that it won't be for everyone.


Thankfully a lot of people think that we're doing something right.


And, there is a really good chance that you'll meet someone on the demo that was involved with the design of the ERP system. We're only a small team so, as of writing, you'll probably get a decision maker from the Fraction team on your demo!


We're really keen for our enquirers to take the trial and test it out for themselves. We want you to sell the software to yourselves.


Prior to the demo, we'd ask you what you want to see, what's difficult at the moment and tailor the demo as best we can to help you see what you need to see. Our demos are online and usually take between forty five minutes and an hour.

## Ok, what about the real system test?



If you like what you see during the ERP demo, Fraction offers a free two week trial.


During this time your team can have a proper play with the system and put a few test orders through the system. See if it works for you and reach out if you get stuck.


This gives you an even deeper experience of Fraction and should help to answer your questions around if we (the software and the team) are a good fit for you.


So, if you have been thinking to yourself that you could side step the ERP demo and the trial phase, I ask you to reconsider. Plus, if there isn't a trial phase I suggest you find out why. This, after all, is one of the great things about the cloud computing era we are in.
