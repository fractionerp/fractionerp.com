It is key that you develop your own selection process. We can't stress enough that you need to find a software solution that is going to help your business. When choosing your selection team, they will need an assessment approach to follow. That's why we created the free guide that you can download from the link above.


Here are a few points that are worth considering when you are going through an ERP selection process:


- Choose a range of software vendors to speak with.
- Be clear about which of your business processes are essential. This is critical when it comes to system functionality. These are known as critical success factors and each one must feature in your chosen system.
- Consider the business requirements, [**the features**](https://fractionerp.com/features), that an ideal ERP system must deliver. This should help complement your evaluation of the critical success factors.
- Find out the implementation process that your vendors propose. Some approaches may be a better fit for your business than others.
- Customer service levels from the vendor can make or break an implementation. This includes during the implementation and when you have gone live. Don't underestimate this as part of your system selection process.
- Determine if the system can generate cost savings for your business. Capture the full implementation cost and see if you can determine a return on investment.
- Decide if you can implement the system with your in-house resources plus the vendor. If not, you need to find an implementation partner that you are happy to work with. Failure to do this will stretch out the implementation timeline.
- Be realistic about the implementation time you will need. The more complex the ERP system, the longer it will likely take to configure and go live.


ERP implementations run more smoothly when you have answered the above questions.
