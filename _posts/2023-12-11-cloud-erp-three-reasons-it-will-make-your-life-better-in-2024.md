As we're nearing the end of the year, I thought I'd write this post for all the manufacturers who aren't sure if a [**cloud ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/) system could make a difference to their business.


Ok, so I'm biased. I've used server based installations of ERP and that was fine, back in the day. Let me share with you three quick points about cloud ERP systems that might help you next year.




## 1. Lower costs



First up, let's mention money. If a cloud ERP system can help your bottom line then that has to be a good reason. Typically server installations have lots of costs that aren't obvious at the outset, normally around hardware. A cloud ERP system usually has a user cost per month and a support cost, which are typically lower than a server based installation.


Fraction ERP has gone a step further. We've cut out the support costs. We've made the software easy to learn ([**with a full support site here**](https://support.fractionerp.com/)) and so we removed the cost altogether.




## 2. Access your data anywhere



Getting your business information anywhere, anytime, is a big selling point of anything cloud. A cloud ERP system is no different. You can access Fraction ERP on your smartphone, tablet (see the photo below, from our own manufacturing business!), PC or from anything that has an Internet browser.


[**Log into your account**](https://fraction.app/) if you need to quickly check where your production orders are up to, or quickly add a new quote whilst at your customer's place of work. You don't need to be tied to your desk to get the most out of cloud ERP.

## 3. Automatic updates



With the ERP system being in the cloud, getting updates to your software is automatic. No more downloading and installing updates. Just open your web browser and you're using the latest version.


This really ties in with point 1, lower costs. Automatic updates reduce your costs via direct staff costs and lost time in the office. In Fraction ERP's case, data is backed up automatically each day so all you need to do is use it!




## 4. Better performance



I said three reasons in the introduction, but this is a bonus fourth point just for Fraction ERP (I can't speak for other systems). We've spent a lot of time stripping back ERP functionality, to get back to something simple enough to learn and complex enough to help you run your factory. ([**You can see the features of our cloud ERP system here**](https://fractionerp.com/features).)


We believe that Fraction ERP will help with lowering your costs and improving your profits. Less admin to carry out your office tasks. Better data to make better decisions. More time working on the business and less time hunting around your business trying to find where your production orders have got up to.
