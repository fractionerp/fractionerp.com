Many businesses that look to move to an ERP system hope that they will get the benefits that they seek. Hope isn't a great strategy but disciplined working is.


By discipline, we mean that the tasks to run the business are identified and carried out religiously. There will be bad days, but if 9/10 go according to plan great results can follow.

## This gets in the way...



ERP processes often differ from the processes of businesses that are in chaos. A common discussion is how can the ERP system be changed to reflect the business' current working practices.


Usually an ERP system is developed through best practice and so a new question arises:


"Could my business performance improve if I adopted the ERP system's processes?"

## Is it worth adopting?



At Fraction ERP, we recommend adopting the ERP's processes. This isn't because we're lazy, it's because we've seen this situation time and time again.


Importantly, this is an essential part of any ERP selection exercise. You need the processes to at least make sense, if they are different to what you are doing.


Use the ERP's way of working and find ways to get the most out of it. Create routines, responsibilities and reporting metrics that tell you that you are on track to hit the results you want.

## Benefits of disciplined working



Making a change to work in line with an ERP system's processes can bring some notable benefits.


[**Decreased admin**](https://fractionerp.com/features) is one of them. Removing the work content around the organising, scheduling and controlling of production orders doesn't just save time, it can reduce mistakes!


This saved time can then be re-directed. Management time can be spent on strategic projects and improvement activities. Bigger business goals can be realised and the cost of your ERP system saved many times over.


Happier customers, repeat business... you get the idea.
