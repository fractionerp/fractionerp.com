If you're like most manufacturing or engineering businesses, you know that handling supplier quotes can quickly become a time sink. Endless email threads, spreadsheets scattered across folders, and the constant chase for updates can slow down your team and eat into valuable production time. That's why Fraction ERP's Request For Quotation (RFQ) process was built to make your life easier.

## Streamlined Administration—No More Chasing Quotes

With Fraction ERP, you can send RFQs to multiple suppliers in just a few clicks. Our centralised dashboard means you can track every quote request, response, and follow-up in one place—no more lost emails or missed deadlines. Suppliers reply directly through the system, so you always have a clear record of who's responded and what they're offering.

## Compare and Decide Faster

Fraction ERP takes the headache out of comparing quotes. All responses are automatically organised and displayed side by side, so you can see price, lead time, and terms at a glance. This makes it simple to spot the best deal without juggling multiple documents or manual calculations.

## Simplified Buying—From RFQ to Purchase Order in Seconds

Once you've chosen your supplier, converting an accepted quote into a purchase order is seamless. No retyping or copy-pasting—just a couple of clicks, and your order is on its way. This reduces errors and keeps your purchasing process moving smoothly.

## Less Admin, More Time for What Matters

By cutting out manual tasks and centralising all your purchasing communications, Fraction ERP gives you back precious hours every week. You can focus on what really matters—delivering for your customers and growing your business.
