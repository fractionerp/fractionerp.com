This article runs through key areas of how Fraction ERP addresses this question

## MRP



MRP, or [**Materials Requirements Planning**](https://fractionerp.com/purchasing), links demand with supply.


In short, if you need to buy something, you'll find it in this module.

## Bill of Materials



To define the list of materials, components and sub-assemblies required for your production orders, our [**Bill of Materials**](https://fractionerp.com/bill-of-materials) module deals with this.


Fraction ERP provides the option to create templates, carry out job costing and capture snapshots of costs.

## Linking purchase orders



We designed Fraction ERP to be flexible. If you want to raise your purchase orders manually and then link back to a works order, you can do this.


We provide easy to follow links, so you can always find your way between the various records in our system.

## Purchase order receipt



When materials arrive on site, you simply book them in. This creates a Goods Received Note (GRN), which we can then push into a cloud based accounts package.


Using the options within Fraction ERP, you can also carry out a goods inward inspection and also have the option to use traceability.
