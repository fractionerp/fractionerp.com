One of our latest updates for Fraction ERP is a parts import tool.


It is something we have wrestled with for a while. How do we make our system faster for our users, when it comes to building the part structures as part of the [**Bill of Materials**](https://www.fractionerp.com/bill-of-materials) (BOM)?


So, we've built an import function to allow the uploading of parts into our [**cloud ERP system**](https://www.fractionerp.com/index).

Simply click on the IMPORT button and upload the template that you have populated. Bingo, hours saved when pulling your Bill of Materials together.
