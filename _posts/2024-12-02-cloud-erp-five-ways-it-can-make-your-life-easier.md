There are many good reasons why using a cloud ERP system makes sense. This short articles looks at five of our favourite.




---



## 1. You can focus on your business activities



With a [**cloud ERP system**](https://fractionerp.com/), we do the heavy lifting when it comes to servers and hardware. This means that you can spend more time working on developing your business.


Instead of worrying about backups, installing updates or what specification of machine you need to run your ERP software on you can leave that to us. Just open a browser and all of your (backed up) data is there. All the latest tweaks and improvements are there, waiting for you to start using them.


Spend more time building your business, rather than administrating it, when you use cloud ERP.

## 2. Access your data anywhere



Being able to easily access your business information on the fly is a benefit to anyone who has ever been stuck with the following conversation:


"Where's my order?"


"I don't know, can you wait until I get back into my factory?"


It is a common discussion but if you can jump onto your ERP system via your smartphone and have a quick look, you end up with happier customers and less to add to your to do list when you make it back into the factory.


We don't advocate working all the time but having quick and easy access to your data can certainly make life easier.

## 3. Easier to learn



When you are limited to running an ERP system through a web browser, it forces you to think about how simple an ERP system really should be. The knock on effect of this is that you end up creating a cloud ERP system that is quicker to learn compared to some traditional offerings.


We promote self onboarding onto Fraction ERP for this very reason! Our support site is available to everyone, with simple walk through videos so that your team can start using Fraction right away.

## 4. It's fast



As long as you have a decent Internet connection, you should find that cloud ERP is fast. We host our data on Google servers to ensure uptime, reliability and data security. This means that our servers are fast.


When our servers are fast, that means we have the opportunity to give you a cloud ERP system that is fast too. Through simplification of ERP and building a system that can operate within a browser we think we've achieved this goal.


Don't waste your staff's time with slow ERP!

## 5. You can integrate easily in the cloud



One of the biggest gains with cloud computing over the last few years is the opportunity to integrate systems. Fraction ERP is no different. We already have a number of integrations built, as requirements from customers that we have brought onboard.


Notably, for many, the integration with cloud accounting programs makes life so much easier. Removing the need to double enter data between systems reducing mistakes as well as saving time.

## Try Fraction ERP out for yourself



The best way to evaluate software is by using it. Another benefit of cloud ERP is that we can set you up with a free account for your business so you can test it out properly.


Get your team involved, play with all of the functions and see how it fits with your way of working. Once you've put a few dummy orders through the system you will be in a better place to make a decision about what option would work best for you.
