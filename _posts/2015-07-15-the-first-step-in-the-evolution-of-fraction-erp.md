Well, we've made a start!


We've thrown out the previous ERP system; its complexity was bogging us down and so the development of Fraction has begun.


The basic order management functions are all present. Quotations, sales order processing, works orders, purchasing and despatch. You can see these laid out on the screenshot below:

This meets the needs of the business' operations and whilst we realise that this doesn't cover the full range of an ERP system this has been a useful experiment.


Why?


The staff fully understand the system. The options on the screens are simple and it actually helps us to complete our day to day tasks (rather than having to administrate the system constantly!).


Or, put it another way, our results are improving every day since introducing this system.




Things are looking up.
