When we designed the initial version of [**Fraction ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/), we wanted something fast. **Ridiculously fast in fact!**


This included the speed of accessing data, deployment (i.e. none!), learning the system and the ease of using the processes.


Flexibility of accessing data has proven to be another benefit, as you can view and manage your business from just a smartphone. No more having to use a remote desktop or waiting until you get into the office. You can pick up a phone or tablet and get straight into your system.


Even though the screen is smaller, you still get full functionality. I (Giles) have a background in Production Management, so I am particularly keen on the shop floor tracking tools within Fraction ERP.


With this in mind, below are screenshots from a 6" smartphone screen:
