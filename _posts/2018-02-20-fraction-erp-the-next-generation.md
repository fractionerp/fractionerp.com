After multiple tweaks to the first iteration of Fraction we have now migrated it to another business, this time with some notable tweaks.


We've kept the simplicity of the interface but now have basic capacity planning and scheduling functions. We've also expanded the Bill of Materials functionality and routing options.


Whilst this still keeps to the Fraction promise (of being a fraction of the complexity) it now gives the system a more complete range of functionality.


Next steps are to finish off the Shop Floor Data Collection and management dashboard functions.
