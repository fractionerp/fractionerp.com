One of the big selling points of implementing an [**ERP system**](https://fractionerp.com/) is its ability to help you manage your processes.


An ERP system isn't just a straight replacement for a paper based or whiteboard system. ERP systems have workflows in them that push the data around the system as various activities are completed.


For example, when you win an order, the quotation becomes a sales order. The data moves to the relevant screen so that you can manage it in the right place. Done right, using an ERP system should reduce the amount of administration required to manage your order book.




## Human nature and lists



Some people 'get' lists and some people don't. Using a list, in whatever area of your life, is more than just writing things down. When you write items down you have won part of the battle of effective management, but clearing the list is where the results lie!


Churning your list by having effective filtering and tying it into a routine is where the magic happens. If you are on top of your ERP data then you have a good chance of being on top of your order book.


If you are on top of your order book then you have a good chance of delivering on time and within budget.


If you deliver on time and within budget, then you have a good chance of winning more customer work and delivering a profit.


Managing your lists, especially via a simple ERP system, is a great business strategy.




## Managing your processes by using your lists



If you define the processes in your business and then find the corresponding list in your ERP system you can really improve the performance of your business. Each process will have an input; in the case of ERP, managing your lists can be the input.


Pull up the right screen in your system and there is your list. Process the list, complete the actions and update the list.


Once the list has been brought up to date your process should, therefore, be up to date.


Add a flexible routine to the processing of your lists (by defining your daily and weekly tasks) and you will be ahead of most businesses, let alone other ERP users.


Most business run off crises and chaos, not processes. Every good manager knows the importance of managing your processes and this simple approach (processing your lists and having a simple routine) can work wonders.




## Fraction ERP's lists
