One of the features of Fraction ERP is the [**nonconformance management software**](https://fractionerp.com/quality) module.


We realised that having your nonconformances within your ERP system is a lot more convenient than trying to juggle a second system.


As we have come from the manufacturing industry, there are a few features we wanted to make sure we included:


- Options to make raising a nonconformance as easy as possible.
- Guidance to identify the root cause of the issue.
- A way to capture the costs.
- An easy way to assign actions.
- A simple way to keep your finger on the pulse with nonconformance closeout.


So, how did we do?


Let us show you this through series of screenshots:
