One of the improvements we have made to our [**cloud ERP system**](https://fractionerp.com/features) is automated emails. These are now in effect for both the quote and purchase order functions.


Information from your quote / purchase order are now taken across to a pre-filled email. You can edit this email prior to sending.


The short video below shows you this in action.
