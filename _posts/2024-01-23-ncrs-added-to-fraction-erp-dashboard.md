Many businesses have a love / hate relationship with their NCRs ([**Non Conformance Reports**](https://fractionerp.com/quality)). They know they need to do them (if they want to avoid repeating the same mistakes time and time again) but juggling them with everything else is a challenge.


Fraction ERP has, for quite some time, had an NCR function built directly into it. Now, you can manage NCRs directly from your [**dashboard**](https://fractionerp.com/dashboard). One system, one place to review, [**one place to manage your business operations**](https://fractionerp.com/index).


Let us give you a quick run through of the NCR system.

If you use a 'Sunrise meeting' approach, or a more traditional daily production meeting, our dashboard can help you to manage your NCRs as part of your normal working day. If your quality management system is managed less frequently (just before an external audit, for example), this approach can save you a lot of time and confusion as you change habits.


And, let's not forget, dealing with NCRs in the manner that they are intended means that you build a better business.
