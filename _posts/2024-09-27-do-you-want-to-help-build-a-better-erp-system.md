One of the things we are proud of here at Fraction ERP is our ongoing discussions with our customers.


During these discussions we find out how they're using our system and often discuss ways that we can improve our cloud ERP system.


...and that is how we build our roadmap.

## Two perspectives, one priority



We combine the ideas and suggestions we receive from our users with our existing plans for Fraction ERP.


Since day one, we've set out to build an ERP system that is simple to use, straightforward and quick to learn.


From the feedback we get, it looks like we doing a good job of it but we are always looking at ways to improve.

## Do you want to help shape Fraction?



To get started with Fraction ERP we recommend an online demo. We can tailor the demo to suit your business' needs and from there we can give you a free two week trial of our system.


Once you have looked at it with your team and put a few orders through Fraction, that's when a [**subscription **](https://fractionerp.com/pricing)would start.


After you have fully got to grips with Fraction, we have a feature inside our app to request a new feature.

After reviewing the request we let the sender know whether we're adding it to our roadmap and, if it is, the rough timescale.

## Built on experience, refinement and customer input



It's always a risk when you open up a suggestion scheme like this but our users are sensible so thankfully it has worked out well to date.


All the key team at Fraction have manufacturing backgrounds and Fraction is embedded in one of our companies, so it has to work well! We've spent the last few years looking to make ERP simpler, faster and help you realise the promise of a joined up business system for factories.


If you want to try a different ERP system and have some good ideas on what an awesome ERP system looks like, drop us a line today and we'll get in touch to organise a first call / demo.
