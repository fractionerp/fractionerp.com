This week we have launched a new feature for [**Fraction ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/), our drag and drop scheduler!


This highly visual tool allows you to see all of the manufacturing operations, by work centre, on one screen.

## Automated scheduling



We've improved our automatic scheduling function and the drag and drop feature allows you to fine tune the schedule.


You can zoom in and out of the schedule, so you can create a rough cut plan that works to the day / week, and zoom in until you are working with a level of detail that suits your business.


Watch the video below to see it in action!

## Instant work to lists



As you can see from the image below, visualising the production schedule is clear.


Any changes to the schedule immediately reflect in the work to lists, ready for your teams to log on and record time / quantities against.


This works great too because our [**shop floor data capture**](https://fractionerp.com/shop-floor-data-capture) licenses come free when you have a paid subscription for your office staff!

## Free two week trial



If you'd like to find out more, [**sign up for a free demo**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo) using the form below.


If you like what you see in the rest of the system, you can take our cloud ERP system for a two week trial. We recommend that prospective users test it out by putting some of their own orders through the system and see how well it works for them.


The new scheduler, including the automated scheduling feature, can save office staff even more time. Combine this with our tracking tools (that come to life when you embrace shop floor data capture) can help production management staff spend some of their time on strategic improvement projects rather than being stuck running around the shop floor!


We hope you enjoy this new feature.
