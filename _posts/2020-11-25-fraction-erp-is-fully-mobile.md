We have made a minor tweak to our user interface on Fraction ERP and now [we're fully mobile](https://fractionerp.com/features).


The original design of Fraction ERP was to be a simple, fast and effective tool that you can use from any web browser on your desktop / laptop machine. Now that we have updated the menu system, you can now use Fraction ERP comfortably from your tablet or smartphone.


This is what the system looks like, when you first log in, on a desktop web browser.

The menu runs along the top and works great on a full sized screen.


When you move to a smaller device, the menu now appears as three horizontal lines, which you can see in the top left hand corner of the image below.

When you click on this icon, the full menu appears and full functionality of the Fraction ERP system is in your hands.

Running an ERP system from a mobile device can be a challenge. Thankfully, this is one challenge that Fraction ERP has overcome.
