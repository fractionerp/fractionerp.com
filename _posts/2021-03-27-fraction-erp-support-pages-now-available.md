At [**Fraction ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/features), we pride ourselves on having designed and developed a simple cloud based ERP system. We haven't skimped on the functionality, but we have ensured that the system is as quick as possible to pick up and master.


We know that when you starting using a software app, the learning curve is a key consideration.


Despite most of our users being able to pick up the tools within an hour of using the system, we also know that some need a little more guidance and reassurance.


Our new support pages are now available at **[https://fractionerp.com/support/](https://fractionerp.com/support/)[](https://fractionerp.com/support/)**

The guide is written in plain English and as you can see from the screenshot, is simple to navigate.


Embedded within the guide are the tutorial videos that walk you through all of the key functions of Fraction ERP.


All of the videos can be seen on our Vimeo channel here: **[https://vimeo.com/showcase/8283149](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8283149)**
