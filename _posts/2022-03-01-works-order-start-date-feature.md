One of the recently introduced features we have added to [**Fraction ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/) is the suggested works order start date.


This feature is here to help you:


- Optimise your production windows.
- Improve cash flow planning.
- Control your purchasing activities.

You can override the start date, so if you want to schedule it for another time, you can! This is one of the benefits of Fraction ERP, you can work flexibly through our system. You are not constrained to work in a fixed way.
