We've made a lot of changes to our [**production scheduling system**](https://fractionerp.com/production-scheduling) over the past few months.


In this blog post I want share a couple of the features that make scheduling so much easier compared to our previous versions.

## Updating scheduled operations



Imagine that you have an order in progress on your shop floor. Let's say it is a batch of 25. You complete the first few and realise that the cycle times you have planned aren't accurate enough.


When you now double click on the operation on our [**Works Order **](https://fractionerp.com/works-orders)view, you can edit the operation (making it longer or shorter). However, we realise that you might already have something scheduled after the operation in question, so click on the 'check schedule conflicts' button and see what it says.


If the check gives you the all clear, save the changes. If it gives you a warning, you can re-shuffle the sub-sequent operations to make some space. Then, you can amend and save.


Of course, if you are reducing the cycle times you can save the changes and then drag your subsequent operations forward to optimise deliveries.

## Splitting operations



Let's imagine another scenario. This time you have a job that needs to run a particular operation across two different workcentres at the same time (let's say it is running behind schedule and you need a way to catch up).


We now have the option to split an operation, at whatever ratio works for you. To keep things simple, this then resets the production schedule and allows you to schedule it again.


Your original 'gaps' on the production schedule will still be there, but now the original operation will appear as two separate bars. The bars can then be located on different work centres.


If you combine this step with the previous one (updating scheduled operations), you can quickly and accurately update your production schedule with just a few clicks.
