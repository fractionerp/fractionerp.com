Order management is at the core of Fraction ERP.


## Order management software - what's that?



If you have ever had to manage your business' orders and tried it on a spreadsheet or a whiteboard, you'll know what we're talking about. There are a few different types of orders that you can manage:


- Sales orders - from receiving the order through to despatching and invoicing it.
- Works orders - controlling the activity within production (getting the order made).
- Purchase orders - ensuring the right orders are placed with your suppliers at the right time.

## What's wrong with a spreadsheet?



Fundamentally, nothing!


But, if you need to duplicate information within your spreadsheet it might become an issue with the integrity of the information.


Or, if you need to share the information with others, you risk data being changed accidentally.


When you get to a certain size, a spreadsheet often isn't the right tool for the job. That's where an ERP system comes in.

## Benefits of an ERP system for order management



There are a number of benefits using an ERP system can bring to a business. Specifically looking at order management:


- You can control who can change the information within the ERP system.
- Linked databases mean that you don't have to manually copy and paste data between spreadsheets.
- An ERP system can join your various bits of data together. The sales data drives production data. This can drive purchasing data and then works order data. The finished works order can push back into the sales order data and close the process out.
- You can save time! Less time administrating and more time growing your business.
