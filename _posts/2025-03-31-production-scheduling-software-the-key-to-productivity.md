This key part of an ERP system can unlock a whole raft of improvements for a business. Production scheduling software is an integral part of an ERP system, ensuring that your operations are sequenced and timed for optimal productivity.

## Why is it key?



When your production scheduling system works, you can:


- Generate work to lists for your teams.
- Review and manage the capacity of your work centres.
- Provide meaningful delivery dates for your customers when you are quoting / acknowledging orders.
- Plan for future resource levels; labour, machinery and shift patterns.
- Spend less time on administrating production and more time on growing the business.

## Fraction's production scheduler



We've created a simple drag and drop [**production scheduling tool**](https://fractionerp.com/production-scheduling) that is available on our [**entry level subscription level**](https://fractionerp.com/pricing).


As soon as you generate a works order, Fraction ERP automatically schedules the operations for the next available date. With the visual drag and drop scheduler you can fine tune the operation start dates.
