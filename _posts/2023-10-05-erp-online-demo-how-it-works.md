We offer an ERP online demo to help you get the most out of your free two week trial.


This short article is to help clarify the process we go through, so there are no surprises from your point of view.


## The purpose of the demo



The reason that we offer a demo, before the free trial, is to save you time. We don't want you wasting your trial time trying to understand how to use [**Fraction ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/index) when we can simply show you how it works in just a few minutes.


## How to book your demo



To request a demo, just visit this page: [**https://fractionerp.com/book-a-demo**](https://fractionerp.com/book-a-demo)


## What happens before the demo



We'll reach out to you to ask you what challenges you are having / what you want to see in the demo. We'll tailor the demo so we can spend the majority of the time focusing on what you need.


We deliver our demos online, so we'll also arrange a suitable time with you and your team.


## What happens during the demo



The demo takes (normally) 45 to 60 minutes. We'll show you the basics, on how to navigate the site, and then the features that you asked us to focus on. If you didn't have a particular focus, we'll give you the quick tour of the entire system.

## What happens after the demo



If you think Fraction ERP could be a good fit for your business (both us as a business and the software) then we can arrange for your free trial to start. We'll set up your own Fraction ERP account, where you are free to use it as you wish.


## What happens after the free trial



If you like what you see, then you can keep your account and [**start a subscription**](https://fractionerp.com/pricing).


If it isn't for you, then we simply close down the trial account and wish you success with your ongoing search for an ERP system.


And that's it for how our ERP online demo works.
