When we designed [**Fraction ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/features), we wanted to make sure it was [**unshackled from the confines of a server deployment**](https://fractionerp.com/blog/5-reasons-cloud-erp-makes-sense). Developing a cloud ERP system seemed like a logical option.


When I (Giles) have worked with consulting clients one of the challenges has been capturing and accessing data when on the move. Notably, can a production supervisor or manager find out what is going on from their mobile device?


The screenshots shared below show how the same screen looks on a smartphone, tablet and desktop.

You might notice on the mobile device screenshots a blue circle with a white plus sign in it. On the smaller screen sizes the information is expanded and compressed by toggling this button (which then becomes a red circle with a white minus sign).


In the screenshots below, you can see how this looks in practice (left hand image).
