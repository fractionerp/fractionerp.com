Do you have a nightmare with your [**goods inward activity**](https://fractionerp.com/purchasing)?


If you have an ERP system in place and have already dealt with this issue, this article isn't for you.


But, if you are pulling your hair out because you are trying to manage quality control with a spreadsheet, a whiteboard or paper... then this is for you.


One of the common issues we hear about from our new customers is how they used to manage the products and materials that were coming into their factories. Some of them needed to be inspected and that was causing them a headache.


Some items wouldn't get checked, others would sit in queues for ages and hold up the start of production. There was no visibility and that made it hard to manage.
