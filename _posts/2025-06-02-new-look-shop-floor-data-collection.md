We've just updated the SFDC ([**shop floor data collection**](https://fractionerp.com/shop-floor-data-capture)) function within Fraction ERP.


As well as simplifying the appearance, making it easier for tablet users, we've added a notes function.


This means that the operators can leave notes against the operations on the works order, helping provide useful information and feedback to management.


You can see the shop floor data capture update in the video below:

## Did you know that shop floor data capture is free in Fraction ERP?



When you take a paid subscription with Fraction ERP, you can have as many shop floor users as you want.


We decided that we didn't want our customers to have to wrestle with an additional cost for tracking shop floor activity effectively, so we included it in the office users' subscription.


For more information on our pricing, [**check out this page**](https://fractionerp.com/pricing).


If you have never used shop floor data capture before, it can save managers hours every day from walking around and trying to find out where production orders are.
