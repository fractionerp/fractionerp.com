[**Drag and drop scheduling**](https://fractionerp.com/production-scheduling) was an advanced feature in ERP systems years ago.


With the reduction in computer processing costs and the general advance of cloud software, this isn't the case anymore.

## What is drag and drop scheduling?



Simply put, this scheduling approach allows you to move the sequence of your manufacturing operations visually.


Clicking onto an operation on a scheduling window and then dragging the operation forward, or backward, to better suit your needs is the essence of this feature.


Once you are happy with new sequence, you can then save the changes to create a new production schedule.

## How Fraction ERP's drag and drop scheduling tool works



When a works order is created in Fraction we have a button that automatically creates a production schedule for that order.


Each new manufacturing operation is appended to the end of the current queue of operations.


You can then view the overall production schedule, visually, either by the works order or by the work centre.

When you review the schedule by work centre you can then drag and drop the operations. The movement of the operations is limited by the working hours you set for each work centre.


When you are happy with the new sequence of operations, just click the update button and the schedule is saved.


The work to lists for your business are automatically updated, saving time updating the instructions for the production staff.

## Simpler ERP



We've worked hard to make Fraction ERP as simple and easy to use as possible.


Our drag and drop scheduling tool is no different. When an ERP system is quick and easy to use, it's also easy to learn. This reduces training costs, reduces mistakes and helps you focus on running your business (rather than running an ERP system!).


If you have any questions about our drag and drop scheduler (or any other part of our system), feel free to drop us a line using the form below.
