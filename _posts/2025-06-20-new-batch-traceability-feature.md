We've added a new feature to Fraction ERP to help track batches through your business.


The [**serial traceability**](https://fractionerp.com/parts-and-inventory) function has been in Fraction for several years, which has been great for those working in engineering that need individually serialised components to be tracked.


Now, for those of you that need to track large quantities of items, as batches, you can now do this simply within Fraction ERP.


The video below provides a walkthrough of how it all works.
