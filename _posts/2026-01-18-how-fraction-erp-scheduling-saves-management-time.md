If you're a production manager or operations director in a small to medium manufacturing business, you know the drill. You spend hours each day walking the shop floor with a clipboard, chasing updates, asking "where are we with the Johnson order?" and trying to piece together what's actually happening in production.

It's exhausting. And it's costing you valuable time that should be spent on strategic improvements, not firefighting.

## The Hidden Cost of Manual Production Tracking

Most manufacturing managers don't realise how much time they lose to production tracking until they add it up. Consider a typical day:

- **Morning rounds:** 30-45 minutes walking the floor, checking progress
- **Status update calls:** 20-30 minutes fielding customer enquiries about order status
- **Afternoon check-ins:** Another 30 minutes confirming what's on schedule
- **End-of-day reconciliation:** 20-30 minutes updating spreadsheets and notes

That's 2+ hours every single day spent simply trying to understand where you are with production. Over a week, that's a full working day lost to tracking rather than improving.

## Why Traditional Methods Don't Work

**Spreadsheets** require constant manual updates and quickly become outdated the moment you save them.

**Whiteboards** show what should be happening, not what is happening in real-time.

**Memory and notebooks** create information silos—only you know the full picture, making you the bottleneck.

The result? You're stuck in reactive mode, constantly chasing information instead of leading your team forward.

## How Fraction ERP's Scheduling System Changes Everything

Fraction ERP's scheduling system is built specifically for make-to-order and make-to-stock operations. It's designed to give you instant visibility without the complexity of enterprise systems.

### Real-Time Production Visibility

No more shop floor walks to gather updates. Fraction ERP shows you exactly where every job is in your production process—right now. Open your dashboard and see:

- Which jobs are in progress
- Which operations are complete
- What's running behind schedule
- Where bottlenecks are forming

**Time saved: 1-1.5 hours per day on status checking**

### Instant Order Status for Customers

When a customer calls asking about their order, you don't need to put them on hold while you investigate. Pull up their order in seconds and give them accurate information immediately.

**Time saved: 20-30 minutes per day on customer enquiries**

### Automated Scheduling Updates

When production realities change—a machine breaks down, materials arrive late, a job takes longer than expected—Fraction ERP automatically adjusts your schedule. No manual recalculation needed.

**Time saved: 30-45 minutes per day on schedule adjustments**

### Centralised Information

Everyone who needs to know can access the same real-time information. Your team stops interrupting you for updates because they can see the schedule themselves.

**Time saved: 15-30 minutes per day on internal status updates**

## The Real-World Impact

One of our customers, a precision engineering firm, was spending over 10 hours per week just tracking production status. After implementing Fraction ERP's scheduling system, that dropped to less than 2 hours—saving over 8 hours of management time every week.

That's a full working day returned to focus on what actually matters: improving processes, supporting the team, and growing the business.

## What You Can Do With Your Time Back

When you're not chasing production status, you can:

- **Reduce lead times** by identifying and eliminating bottlenecks
- **Improve on-time delivery** by spotting issues before they become crises
- **Plan capacity more effectively** with accurate production data
- **Support your team** with coaching and development instead of micromanaging
- **Win new business** by responding faster to enquiries and quotes

## Getting Started Is Simple
