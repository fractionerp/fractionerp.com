Despite having ERP systems installed, many manufacturing businesses still schedule their operations outside of ERP. What seems quicker to do for many people we speak to, using an ERP system for your manufacturing scheduling is often better in the long run.


In this short article we'll run through some of benefits of using [**manufacturing scheduling software**](https://fractionerp.com/production-scheduling) and how Fraction ERP has addressed some of the related challenges that businesses face.

## Visualisation



Although this can be achieved through other means, an ERP's scheduling tool can produce visual outputs that make it easy to see how the queue of operations will run through your factory.


Mentally juggling the queues of work and the sequence of activities is enough to fry most people's brains. We've also built a feature into our [**drag and drop scheduler**](https://fractionerp.com/production-scheduling) that allows you to see all the related operations when you click on an operation.


This visualisation helps you to speed up the scheduling process, especially when compared to many manual methods of scheduling.

## Work to lists



[**Creating work to lists**](https://fractionerp.com/shop-floor-data-capture) for your teams to follow is another chore that manufacturing scheduling software can take in its stride.


In most scheduling tools, when you change a sequence of operations, the work to list is updated. The work to list is the natural output of the scheduler. If you write out manual work to lists, this could be eliminated if you used a scheduling tool for your factory.

## Reduced administration



One of the great things about an ERP system is that you can reduce the amount of administrative tasks that are required. When you use whiteboards, spreadsheets or paper based systems you can end up copying and re-inputting data several times.


With an ERP system you can put the data in once, at the front end, and then use this data through the life of the order. Less time administrating and more time running your business.

## Auto schedule and shunting



In Fraction ERP we've built in a number of features designed to make your life easier when it comes to manufacturing scheduling. Two of these are the auto schedule function and shunting.


As the name implies, auto scheduling is leaving Fraction ERP to determine how the sequence of operations, across all work centres, should be laid out. We've built in some additional features, should that be a jump too far.


The one at a time schedule works with the same logic as auto schedule but you get to choose the sequence that the orders are placed on the scheduling board. This changes the consumption of capacity and hence the overall schedule will be different.

Auto schedule can be used periodically to reset your schedule if you have notable problems with projects / breakdowns etc... We also have the ability to pin operations, if certain works orders cannot be moved around but others can.


And, to save time making minor tweaks to your schedule when things slip, we've included a shunting function. This 'shoves' the schedule along the timeline if operations aren't being completed on time, until they are booked off by the shop floor staff.

## A plea to those already with ERP



If you already have an ERP system, but aren't using your scheduling function, why not?


The ability to streamline your office operations and improve on time delivery cannot be ignored. Even if you feel that your system is far too complicated, there is often something withing the system that can be used to push you in the right direction.


We urge you to have another look and see if you can get this part of your system operational. The benefits typically outweigh the effort to get it up and running.
