A question that runs through the mind of every software user (ERP or not) is 'how good is this on my phone?'.


We are proud that Fraction ERP can run on a smartphone comfortably. It is a different experience but that is to be expected.


But how much?


Below are a series of screenshots, taken from a smartphone and a desktop PC. Hopefully, this will give you a good idea of how Fraction ERP can be used when you're on the move. If you need to track an order, change a quote, or anything else, it can be done from a smartphone with our [**cloud ERP solution**](https://fractionerp.com/).

## Dashboard



The first page you come to within Fraction ERP, the dashboard, allows you to manage your business by exception reporting. Sunrise meetings / production meetings can be really easy to run, especially when you use our [**task management module**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-task-management).

## Works Orders



Manufacturing orders can be created, modified and launched on a smartphone if the desktop version is not available. This includes editing the bill of material structure and routing.

## Scheduling



The graphical scheduling boards (including the capacity bars) work just as well on a mobile device as they do on a larger computer screen.
