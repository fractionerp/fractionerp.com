One of the biggest concerns with ERP systems is the budget.


For most businesses, they expect to pay for implementation, support and the system itself.


Implementing an ERP system can take time, often longer than expected, adding to the cost...




Hang on! Why am I painting such a bleak picture?




Unfortunately, this is what many people experience.


And, this is exactly why we developed Fraction ERP to help you avoid this same problem.




How have we done this?


1. We don't charge for implementation.
2. Support is included in the subscription.
3. The monthly subscription can be started with a handful of users and then you can expand as you use more and more of our system.




We've even included shop floor data capture licenses for free and you don't have to buy any new hardware as Fraction ERP is a cloud based system.

So, if you are concerned about budgets running away from you, then drop us a line and we can organise an online demo for you. If you like what you see, you can then take our free two week trial. We can set up a Fraction account for you, to make sure it will do what your business needs. If you like it, you can start a subscription and keep the account. If it isn't for you, not a problem.


We want you to experience the benefits of ERP without the downsides. Hopefully we've done a good job!
