## **We've had enough!**



We've had enough of purchasing ERP systems that have too many features and complexity that any normal small to mid sized manufacturing business needs.




## **So, what are we going to do about it?**



We're building our own.


We've decided to call it Fraction ERP because:


- It will be a fraction of the complexity.
- It will be a fraction of the price of other systems.


But, it won't compromise on being an effective business solution that will help us to drive up our on time delivery performance and reduce our operating costs.




## **What's our intention?**



Once we get it working reliably we'll share it with the wider world. More importantly, we'll share it with the people that want freedom from the shackles of an overly complicated ERP system that burdens them with additional administrative resources and slow / unresponsive decision making...
