If you have a large number of products in your business, that are variations on a theme, then creating Bills of Materials and manufacturing routes might seem like a lot of unnecessary work.




We understand this and that is why we built a quick way to copy and customise BoMs and routes. We come from a Lean background, where mass customisation and rapid turnaround of data is expected. Fraction ERP has been built on this premise and in the video below you can see just how quick it is to create a BoM and route from a template

Creating a template is simple too. Just access one of your existing BoMs within the system and save it as a template.




Using this approach means that if you have families of products, or need to rapidly add products with generic manufacturing routes, then creating the data you need in an ERP system just takes a matter of moments.
