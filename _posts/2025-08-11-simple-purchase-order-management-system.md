When we're organising demos with prospective customers, we often get asked if Fraction ERP is a [**purchase order system**](https://fractionerp.com/purchasing) and is it simple.


In both cases, yes!

## Raise orders from MRP



As you'd expect from an ERP system, Fraction ERP will allow you to raise purchase orders based on the demand from your work orders.


Our [**MRP screen**](https://fractionerp.com/purchasing) has a number of easy to apply filters to help you speed up the purchasing process.


We also have the option to group demand, so if you get a discount on certain purchasing quantities, you can ensure that your purchase orders are consolidated.


If you repeat buy a component / material from a specific supplier you can set this up, again speeding up the purchasing process.

## Raise standalone purchase orders



If you want the buy without using the MRP screen, perhaps for an ad-hoc purchase, you can do this too.


If the item later appears in the [**bill of materials**](https://fractionerp.com/bill-of-materials) for the work order, you can link them back up manually.


Fraction ERP allows you to create items 'on the fly', again speeding up the process of raising purchase orders.

## RFQ system



If you aren't sure who the best supplier will be for your order, you can raise a Request For Quotation (RFQ) and then convert the best response to a purchase order. This certainly saves time and reduces confusion whilst you juggle the rest of the day job!

## Purchase order approval



Within Fraction ERP we allow purchase order approval levels to be set. If you want full control over the purchasing process, this option is for you.

## Email directly to suppliers



Once you have an approved purchase order, you can click on the email button and send this off directly to your supplier.


The order can be downloaded as a PDF document and emailed that way, if you prefer.

## Receiving orders



When the order arrives at your business, our goods received function allows you to [**bring the stock into Fraction ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/parts-and-inventory) and then allow it to be allocated to the order you need it for.


If you select for the item to be inspected when it arrives, that can be triggered at this stage.


Also, if you want traceability (serial or batch) for the items, this can also be triggered at this stage if the part has been setup in that manner.
