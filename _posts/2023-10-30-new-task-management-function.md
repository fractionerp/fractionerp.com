To help our users get the most out of our [**dashboard**](https://fractionerp.com/dashboard), we have introduced a simple task management function into Fraction ERP.


We all know that running a business successfully takes more than just operating an ERP system well. A sunrise meeting is a great way to help do this, by managing exceptions from your business activities to focus team activity.


Our dashboard is designed to help you drill down to the activities that need attention. Our latest upgrade to Fraction ERP is the task management module. This allows you to assign tasks to your ERP users, which you can then track via your dashboard.


The video below provides an overview of the task management module.
