[**Our recent update**](https://fractionerp.com/product-updates) has brought with it an upgrade to our [**Shop Floor Data Collection**](https://fractionerp.com/shop-floor-data-capture) (SFDC) tracking screens.


You can now see, at a glance, which workcentres are operating, along with which team members are clocked onto a job.


This helps answer the following four management questions:




---



## 1. What's going on?



Now, at a glance, you can tell what parts of your factory are busy and which aren't.

**Check on active / inactive resource groups at a glance**

## 2. Is production on time?



Next, is your production running on time? Apart from Fraction's high level works order tracking tools, our SFDC log screen shows you how much time is remaining on the operations that are booked onto.


Stick to the times and you should be on time with your schedule.

## 3. Is production profitable?



Reviewing the actual production times, against the planned production times, should indicate if you are profitable with your orders.


The SFDC logs screen allows you to quickly review these planned versus actual times, so you can make changes to your processes or your times next time around.

## 4. Who do I need to support?



Similar to the 'which workcentre is producing?' question, Fraction ERP can do the same for operators.


As our ERP system allows you to monitor both operatives and workcentres at the same time (including scheduling and capacity planning), you can quickly view who is clocked on and who isn't.

## SFDC users are free with paid subscriptions



We don't want our new customers to worry about the cost of adding SFDC users (normally shop floor staff) to their ERP subscription. So, we made this user group free as long as their is a paid subscription for two main users.
