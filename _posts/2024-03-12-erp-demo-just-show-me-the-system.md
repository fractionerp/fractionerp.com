One of the concerns many people have, when looking for a new ERP system is the painful sales process they may have to go through. We understand that most of you don't want 'the dance' and just want a [**demo**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo).


It's easy for us to say that you won't have this experience with us but let me try to explain why this is the case.


When you get in touch with us you'll get one of the following people. I'll include their professional backgrounds to help make the point clearer.




**Patrick Chester** - Engineer


**Giles Johnston** - Engineer


**Junzi Sun** - Programmer (and Engineer!)

## Don't expect the following!



Don't expect a slick sales presentation.


Don't expect a clever closing routine.


Don't expect us to try and push something in your diary.


That isn't us. We're proud to say that we aren't sales people.




Before the ERP demo we might ask you a couple of questions, such as:


- What do you want us to focus on during the demo?
- Do you have any business processes that you need to emulate inside an ERP system?




During the demo we'll show you Fraction ERP. Hopefully we show you what you need to see. Hopefully you'll get an idea of what we're like too. That's it.

**We just want to keep ERP simple! This is our visual scheduling board.**

If you like the system, you can take the two week free trial.


If Fraction ERP works for you, great, we'll happily sign you up as new customers.


If it isn't for you, no worries. At least you're one demo further on with your quest.

We're focused on our mission:


**"To put low cost and simple ERP into the hands of every manufacturing SME at a time when they are fed up of broken spreadsheets, whiteboards and paper based systems."******


We're not focused on applying the latest sales techniques...
