One of the brilliant features of Fraction ERP is our simple [**task management tool**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-task-management). It can help you get the most out of your team management, directly supporting your production output, but it can also help you with your continuous improvement projects.


We built the tool originally to help manage the actions that come out from a [**daily production meeting**](https://fractionerp.com/dashboard). Maximising visibility of tasks and removing the need for another app to capture your tasks outside of your [**ERP system**](https://fractionerp.com/index). But, as you can create categories to suit your business, you can create them for your continuous improvement projects too.


Creating categories is easy, navigate from the options menu down to the **TASKS** section. Click on the **edit** button and you can see your current options.

You can either rename the categories, or add a new category name via the bottom of the selection.

When you create a new task, choose the appropriate category from the drop down list.

Viewing the project / category is simple. Click on the **Category** filter and select your preference from the list. The task list will update to show you tasks tagged with that category. You can then review the actions as part of your continuous improvement meeting (or any other kind of meeting for that matter).

The tasks also flow through to the dashboard. The tiles show you how many tasks there are, how many are assigned to you and how many are overdue.

Fraction ERP can really help your business with the tracking of continuous improvement tasks, as well as general business tasks. If you tie this into the dashboard, you have a really powerful management approach and an effective cloud ERP system to help you drive up your productivity and on time delivery performance.
