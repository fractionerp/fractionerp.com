One of the benefits that a cloud ERP system can bring to your business is the digital factory concept - that your ERP system is a digital replica of your actual manufacturing business.


In essence, this approach allows your ERP system to run in real time, letting you dynamically changing your schedules and keeping your employees up to date.


We achieve this in several ways, including:


- A simple and effective visual scheduling board.
- The ability to quickly balance production schedules.
- Keeping teams up to date with the live production schedule.


The video below provides an overview of these functions and shows you just how quick and easy it really is.
