We know how important it is for an [**ERP system**](https://fractionerp.com/features) to help streamline businesses. This is why we chose to integrate with cloud based finance systems from day one.


First, we integrated with Xero. Shortly afterwards we linked up with QuickBooks. Now, Fraction ERP can integrate with Sage Business Cloud Accounting.

## Saving you time



Our finance integration allows you to post data straight into the finance package. You can send through [**purchase orders**](https://fractionerp.com/purchasing) and sales invoices with a single click.


This means that your finance team can get information faster and not have to key in the data again. We all know that keying in data is where errors creep in. So, this also reduces mistakes in the business.
