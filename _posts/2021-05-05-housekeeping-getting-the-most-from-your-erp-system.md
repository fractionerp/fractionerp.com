It's a perennial fear. You spend a chunk of money on an ERP system and then watch it fail to deliver:


- It doesn't help you with your on time delivery performance.
- It doesn't help you to reduce your admin burden.
- It doesn't help you to reduce your costs.
- It doesn't help you to grow...


Worse still, workarounds can start to appear. If adoption doesn't happen when you roll out the software, this is likely.


## Managing your way out of this situation



Managing your ERP system is key to avoiding these problems. One of the best management tools is housekeeping. This is often considered a boring topic, but is essential.


When you have 'clean data' it helps you to achieve better results. Your information is useable and decisions are timely. Your actions follow your growth plans and are less reactive.
