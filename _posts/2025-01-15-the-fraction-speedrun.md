Are you familiar with the idea of a speedrun?


They are popular in the video game world; complete a stage of the game as fast as possible.


Well, Fraction ERP isn't quite in the video game category but it is interesting that we get notes from our customers about how quick it is to use our [**cloud ERP system**](https://fractionerp.com/).

## 28 minutes



We received a note the other day from one of our users about part of their day:


"I just turned around an enquiry in 28 mins - new parts, new BOMs, checked the routing, updated my labour rates and materials costing for this year and send back the quote. Plus, I wasn't just working on Fraction during this time."




So, we're not sure just what the world record for doing this in Fraction ERP is, but they continued:


"28 mins includes converting files to PDFs and storing the drawings with the parts... it really is so nice to use."

## Reason for sharing



We regularly keep in touch with our clients to see how they are getting on and if they are getting to grips with the latest [**features in our ERP system**](https://fractionerp.com/features).


Not only do we enjoy reading feedback like the note above, but it helps to dispel the myth that ERP systems are slow and clunky.


We've spent a lot of time and effort to streamline and simplify how Fraction ERP works. We even have a [**full support site**](https://support.fractionerp.com/) to help new users onboard themselves to Fraction (eliminating the cost of support and keeping monthly costs low).

## Forty five minute demo



Our [**online demos**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo) take around forty five minutes to an hour to deliver. We don't complete every task in the system (so no speedrun claims!) but it should give you a really good idea if Fraction ERP would be a good fit for your business.


If you like what you see in the demo, you can take Fraction ERP for a test run in your business for two weeks. We would set up a cloud account for you and your team and they can input some real orders into the system and you can see how it responds to how you want to work.


If you want to [**organise a demo**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo) (which we recommend, before diving into the free trial), simply fill in the form below.
