One of the benefits of a [**cloud ERP system**](https://fractionerp.com/) like Fraction ERP is that is can save you a lot of time when it comes to tracking orders in your factory.


If you have already seen our [**pricing page**](https://fractionerp.com/pricing), you'll know that we include the [**shop floor data capture**](https://fractionerp.com/shop-floor-data-capture) (typically abbreviated as SFDC) licenses free with paid office user licenses. The benefits of having your shop floor team logging onto Fraction include:


- Automated tracking of production progress.
- Plan versus actual for production orders.
- Utilisation data, for both operatives and machinery.


This article is focused on the first benefit, automated tracking.

## Shop Floor Data Capture - high level overview



To help you understand how Fraction ERP works, at a high level, with this part of the system consider the following flowchart:

## How to save time with shop floor data capture



If you are used to walking around your shop floor to find out where your production orders are, using Fraction ERP could save you a notable amount of time every day.


Loading a works order into Fraction allows you to [**schedule the operations**](https://fractionerp.com/production-scheduling). If you have set up the workcentres correctly, this could be the end of the scheduling story. Realistically, you may want to move the operations around and further optimise your production schedule.


Our drag and drop scheduler allows you to simply move the operations on the screen and tweak the sequence.

When the schedule is saved, the operations list is updated automatically. This list is the work to list for your shop floor team. No more having to write out what people are meant to do! The filter system on the operations list allows you to provide detailed lists of work for your team (with deadlines!) at the touch of a button. This can also be saved as a shortcut on a tablet or PC for speed later on.


Once the team have their list, they can log onto an operation using the shop floor data capture part of Fraction ERP.

Once the operative has completed an operation, they update the Fraction order via shop floor data capture. This removes the operation from the scheduling board and the work to list. It also updates the high level production order tracker.

This chain reaction is how a typical shop floor production manager / supervisor can start to save time with their daily duties. It also helps to improve visibility for the entire production team as well as providing useful data that the management team can use to better manage production going forward.

So, if you have ever wondered how shop floor data capture linked back to Fraction ERP's scheduler and tracking screens, now you know!
