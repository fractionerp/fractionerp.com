There are many scheduling tools for small businesses. [**Fraction ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/) is one of them.


But, many are so complex that it can be difficult to make the leap from spreadsheets and whiteboards.


We think that smaller manufacturers deserve something simpler, something more manageable.


Like fashion, we think that scheduling software for manufacturers should be back in vogue. The new black!

## How we've kept it simple



Our [**visual scheduling boards**](https://fractionerp.com/production-scheduling) require a few clicks and you're done.


There's nothing complex to organise and you can keep it as simple as you want it. We have weekly, daily and hourly scheduling options.


Each option allows you to see the committed capacity before you add more work to the bucket.

## Why we have layered scheduling



So many businesses spend too much time scheduling. We wanted Fraction to be easy to use and save you time.


The weekly scheduling approach is great for businesses that want to have a rough schedule in their business.


The daily scheduling and hourly scheduling options are for businesses that need more precision on when they carry out their operations.


The great news is that if you working on the daily or hourly scheduling you can start with a rough plan and then firm up as you get closer to starting production.


We all know that production orders can move back and forward. Why waste time moving operations back and forward when you can do this closer to the time? Fine tuning the schedule as late as possible uses the least amount of admin time.
