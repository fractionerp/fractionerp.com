[**Simple ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-manufacturing-workflow.php) is a term used more commonly nowadays.


When ERP started off in the early 1990s it was a complex piece of software. For many businesses looking into this, the price tag was certainly proportional to the complexity!


There are a number of companies, Fraction ERP included, that aim their software at the part of the market that isn't looking for a mammoth software solution.

## The benefits of simple



When you look at a simple ERP solution, there are a few things worth noting:


- They are easier to setup.
- They are quicker to learn.
- They are cheaper to run.


This goes back to the saying of 'using a sledgehammer to crack a nut'. If you don't need expensive and complex, a simple ERP system could be for you.

## Who is simple ERP for?



Whilst there is no definitive answer to this question, we made Fraction ERP with these two groups in mind:


1. Manufacturers that don't already have an ERP solution. They want to take the next step, onwards from spreadsheets and whiteboards, but don't want to burden themselves financially in the process.
2. Manufacturers that are tired of their existing ERP solution. They want something simpler, easier to use and more effective for their business.


And, being simple doesn't just mean less functionality. It takes time to look at the sequence of actions and finding ways to remove clicks so that you can spend more time managing and less time administrating.
