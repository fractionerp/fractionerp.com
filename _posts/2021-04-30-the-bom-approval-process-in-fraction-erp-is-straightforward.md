The BOM approval process in Fraction ERP is straightforward. When you change the operations, or the part structure, the status reverts to draft.

As you can see from the screenshots, we have a simple workflow to control BOM changes. The ability to approve the BOM (through CHECK and APPROVE stages) depends on the user's settings.

A further security check with the BOM status is the launching of work orders. If the BOM is not approved, the system will stop you from releasing the work order. This prevents mistakes from slipping through into production.
