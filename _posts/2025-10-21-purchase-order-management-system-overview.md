## MRP (Materials Requirements Planning)



Most of the purchasing demand is handled by our customers via the [**MRP page**](https://fractionerp.com/purchasing). This allows material demand to be reviewed and converted into purchase orders.


We also provide the option to group demand, to reduce the number of order lines generated, or to generate an 'RFQ'.

## Request for Quotation (RFQ)



The RFQ process allows you to send out invitations to your supply chain to provide price and availability for the items you need to purchase.


Once you have the prices back, you can select the most favourable and convert the RFQ into a purchase order. This process closes down the other enquiries and you can email the purchase order to your supplier directly from within Fraction.

## Goods Received



Once the materials have arrived at your premises, you can book them into stock. We also have the option to be able to trigger a goods inward inspection process and different traceability methods for the items once into stock / production.

## Manual Purchase Orders



If, however, you just want to raise purchase orders without following this flow you can do.


Manual purchase orders are part of our system and you can link supply back to works orders if present in the system.


Purchase order data can also be pushed into your online accounting software if you use Xero, Quickbooks or Sage (full cloud version).
