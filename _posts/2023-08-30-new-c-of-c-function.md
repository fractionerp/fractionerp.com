We've just added a Certificate of Conformity (C of C) report to Fraction ERP.


If you need to provide a formal document, to confirm that your products conform to a specific standard, then you can produce these via the Shipments page:

To setup the C of C, you need to add in the text via the [**Options page**](https://support.fractionerp.com/options) and add a signature via the Company Profile page.


Simply click on the create button, then you can print / download the certificate to send on to your customers.
