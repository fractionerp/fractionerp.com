Our new stock alert function is now available within[** Fraction ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/features).


Any part showing a current stock level lower than the pre-defined minimum stock quantity will now trigger a stock alert.


To see all of the items that fall within this remit you just need to click on the 'STOCK ALERT' button from the Parts screen, as you can see in the image below.

From reviewing this screen you can then make the decision to replenish stock (by purchasing stock, or manufacturing it) and actioning that decision with just a couple of additional mouse clicks.


We have also added this view to our dashboard, making this a quick item to access when you first log into the system.

This new feature makes a good addition to the simplified and streamlined stock management approach we have taken with Fraction ERP.
