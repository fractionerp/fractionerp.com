Many of the businesses that we speak to, do not have an existing ERP system. Most of them operate with a combination of paper-based systems, whiteboards and spreadsheets.


Is this the same for you too?


## Why are you waiting for a new world of simplicity, business integration and working flexibility?



One of the big fears that we hear about moving to an ERP system is “it's too much of a leap for our company". We get that. Changing systems is one thing and changing people can be another ball game all together.


A change like this doesn't have to be a massive ordeal. Fraction ERP is a straightforward ERP system and easy to pick up. Implementation can be achieved without having to 'freak out' the team.

## One step at a time



With Fraction ERP, it is possible to break down the implementation of our ERP system into smaller steps.


This will take the pressure off the team and allow everyone to learn the new system as you go. Fraction is flexible to allow you to use some or all the modules, without many rules to follow.


### Basic configuration



Setting up Fraction ERP isn't time consuming. The initial set-up for things like users, options and work centers is a stand alone task for day one.


### Contracts and invoicing



Using [**quotes and sales orders**](https://vimeo.com/519886128) along with [**invoicing**](https://vimeo.com/532613354), allows the customer facing elements of Fraction to be rolled out first. At this point, you can keep on working the way you are for everything else.


[**Delivery notes**](https://vimeo.com/532607112) can be produced for your orders, which starts to create stock transactions.


You can create new customers and parts 'on the fly', so you don't have to worry about having everything ready for a big launch day. It’s worth mentioning we can import parts, customers and suppliers from Excel into your Fraction account.


### Work Orders without detailed BOMs



You can create simple manufacturing orders with Fraction ERP, without [**creating detailed BOMs**](https://vimeo.com/519885601). A 'manufactured' part is required for a new BOM, created with just a few clicks.


By creating a basic manufacturing route, with even a single operation (e.g. manufacture product), a works order can be created. This links a sales contract to production demand; telling production the part numbers, qty and delivery dates. This can run along side your current process, making sure nothing gets missed.


If you make to stock, you can also start [**raising stock work orders**](https://fractionerp.com/blog/make-to-stock-work-orders).


Later on, when you are ready, parts and detail routings can added to the BOMs. This will enable the job costing functionality within the BOM module.


### Purchasing and inventory control



The [**purchasing function**](https://fractionerp.com/blog/simplified-purchasing) can be used at any time. Start by raising your purchase orders in Fraction to control expenditure and [**manage inventory**](https://fractionerp.com/blog/perpetual-inventory-and-fraction-erp). The [**stock alert function**](https://fractionerp.com/blog/stock-alert-function-now-added) will keep inventory under control from now on.


Once you start creating works orders with part requirements, you can use the part demand function to process purchase orders. Parts can be aggregated and scheduled so you can start reducing expenditure.


### Production scheduling & capacity planning



As the BOM detail increases, you can unleash production scheduling tools to create meaningful '[**work to lists**](https://vimeo.com/519886045)' for your production operators.


As more data enters Fraction ERP, you can manage capacity for each work center. [**Effective capacity management**](https://fractionerp.com/blog/balance-your-shop-floor-workloads-with-simple-scheduling-tools) boosts utilisation and on time delivery.


### Production tracking



Using the building blocks you have already implemented, [**works order tracking**](https://fractionerp.com/blog/shop-floor-tracking-tools) and [**shop floor data capture**](https://fractionerp.com/blog/shop-floor-data-collection-the-shop-floor-view) can be deployed.


When a customer calls about an order, you can now look up in real time where the order is in production, even if you are sitting at the kitchen table!

## Develop your own implementation plan



The point I want to get across is that you don't have to scare your team with the implementation of an ERP system. ERP systems aren't all the same and the comments above relate to Fraction ERP, which is designed with small companies in mind.


You can take our ERP system and roll it out in controlled steps. Train your team on a specific function and then 'see saw' your business processes from separate spreadsheets and documents to an integrated cloud hosted platform.


You only move on to the next step of the implementation plan when you are ready to do so. It can be really useful to agree in advance what results you want to see / experience to confirm that you are ready to move to the next step.


It is possible to migrate from non-ERP systems to an ERP system without the business keeling over or the team mutinying at the same time. If you want to discuss how you can deploy Fraction ERP in your business then [**get in touch using the contact form below**](https://fractionerp.com/contact).


We'll be happy to discuss your own particular challenges!


We hope that your transition to an ERP system is smooth and (relatively) pain free.
