Let's face it, ERP demos can take time.


If you are busy running a business, it can feel like this is time you don't have.


In this short article we will share with you how you can get the most from an ERP demo, especially the [**demos delivered by Fraction ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo)!


If you get your approach to ERP demos right, you can save a whole load of time and find the right system at the same time!




## 1. Know what you want to achieve



This might seem obvious, but what do you want to achieve from your ERP demo?


Do you want a general introduction?


Do you want to see specific features and functions?


Make this clear to the ERP company you are having a demo with. This makes it easier for them to plan a demo than waste hours of your time.


## 2. Check out the ERP company before arranging a demo



Again, this might seem obvious. Check out the company before arranging a demo.


Just because you have heard of a company doesn't mean that they are going to be a good fit for your business.


Find out who they serve. Find out who they designed the software for. If they have testimonials, give them a read.


Be selective. You can do a lot of evaluation via websites before engaging the company itself. You can fill every day with demos; we don't recommend that strategy.


## 3. Know what is a must have and what is a nice to have



This ties in with the first two points. When you are looking for an ERP system, know what is critical for your business.


Every ERP system has a basic function set that is similar. Every ERP system has some features that make it different.


The reality is that you are looking for the best fit for your organisation. Some aspects of the ERP system will make your business better. But, there might also be some elements to the system that will require you to adapt your current working practices.


Be aware of this fact and be clear as to what you need, what you will compromise on and what you won't.


This makes having an ERP demo more focused and helps streamline your evaluation process.

## Create a quick scoresheet



If you haven't already started with your ERP demo 'beauty parade', we recommend that you create a simple scoresheet.


After each demo, quickly score the demo. How well did it fit your needs? How well can you work with the ERP system's team? How difficult do you think implementation will be? How expensive is the system?


With a handful of factors, you can quickly whittle the ERP options you have identified for demo down to the last couple for a deeper evaluation.


## Set a timeline at the start of the demo



It is a risk that if you don't tell the ERP vendor before the demo how long you want it to take, it will take as long as they want it to be. Put yourself in the driving seat and tell them how much time you have available.


It might be that you want a half hour intro demo, to look at just a handful of features, or longer to go in depth. You can spend too much time on demos if you aren't careful. Plus, most people who build ERP system love their system (we do!) and it is possible to get carried away (and lost) during the demo. You don't need to be polite. (We've sat through many ERP demos in our previous lives and we get it! Our pledge is to avoid taking longer than necessary on the demo.)
