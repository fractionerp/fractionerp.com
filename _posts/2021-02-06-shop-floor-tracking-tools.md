When we set out to build [**Fraction ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/), one of my (Giles) key topics was the production tracking tools. Like Patrick, I had previously experienced both really good shop floor tracking tools and really bad tracking tools.


When you have a customer getting in contact for an update on their production order it is really helpful if you can respond quickly with an accurate update. Working blind isn't a great strategy. I've tried it and it isn't great...


The tools that are currently included with Fraction ERP are:


- Works Order tracking screen.
- Simple operation completion method.
- SFDC (Shop Floor Data Collection) tools.
- Work to list / operation queues.
- Shop floor work in progress boards (linked to SFDC)


You can find out more about these tools in the walkthrough video below.
