Support for Sage 50 Manufacturing ends 30th September 2021;


Are you ready for a change?


(Honestly, we think its overdue anyway)

In its day, Sage 50 Manufacturing was great system for small manufactures and it easily integrated with the very popular Sage accounts. Times have changed; high speed internet, mobile devices and cloud technologies have leapt forward since the hay-days of Sage and installing software from a CD-Rom.


From ordering pizza to running manufacturing companies, cloud software is faster, highly reliable, available anywhere and enables functionality that we could only have dreamed of 15 years ago – including tracking your pizza on touch screen mobile.


If you are still using Sage Manufacturing, we think its time you embraced the now and moved to [**Fraction ERP**](https://fractionerp.com/features).
