We have just published our free guide '**Looking Before You Leap**'. The guide covers the areas of:


- Selecting a project lead.
- ERP system selection.
- Developing an effective implementation plan.
- Managing the system itself.
- Mastering, and realising the potential, of an ERP system.


The guide isn't a sales brochure for Fraction ERP, it should help you with any ERP system. So, even if you aren't looking for a new system, there should be something in there to help you. We all know that getting the return on investment from your ERP system means more than just switching it on!
