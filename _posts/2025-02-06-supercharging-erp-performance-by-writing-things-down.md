We've met a lot of different manufacturing businesses over the years. Quite a few of them think an ERP system is a magic solution. Fire it up and suddenly problems go away.


We wish it was that simple...

## ERP: Part of management



An ERP system is a tool. It fits into the manager's toolbox to help people administrate and plan their manufacturing and order processing activities with less effort and better results. Unfortunately it isn't magic.


There are always other things you need to do around ERP, including the physical acts of speaking with suppliers, leading the production teams, maintenance etc...


When these tasks come up, some people write them down and some don't. There is a big difference between the two and you can usually see this a mile off in terms of an individual's effectiveness.


We build a [**task management tool**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-task-management) directly into Fraction ERP to help you with this challenge.

## Quick start



We've made Fraction ERP as simple and effective as possible. We want users to be able to intuitively pick up the system and start working with it. In just a few hours you can be set up and working, gaining confidence with the system as you go.


The [**Task Management**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-task-management) module fits in beautifully with the [**dashboard**](https://fractionerp.com/dashboard), showing you and your team what tasks are overdue / allocated to you. If you run some form of daily production meeting, or a Sunrise meeting, this tool can help you to capture the actions there and then, and subsequently manage them via following meetings.

## Free two week trial



To help you find out if Fraction ERP would be a good fit for your business, we offer a two week trial free of charge.


This is a good window of time to let your team place some orders through our system, create some parts, track the production activity and test it out generally. We recommend an [**online demo**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo) with us first, to answer any questions you have about our system but you can dive into a trial by [**filling in the form below**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-online-demo).


We also have a [**video demo**](https://fractionerp.com/erp-demo-video.php) run through available here, which can be viewed in less than forty minutes.

## Start writing



Whether you join us here at Fraction ERP, or not, encouraging your teams to write down their tasks and then complete their tasks will make your day to day management much easier.


And, if that hasn't convinced you, then perhaps this Chinese proverb will:


"It is better to have a short pencil than a long memory"


Yes, avoid burning out your brain by writing things down rather than trying to remember them!
