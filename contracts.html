    <h4>Speed up your quote process</h4>
    <p>With our quote snapshot function and the ability to create quotes on the fly, our contracts module will
      speed up your quotation process. Get more quotes out to your customers in less time and with less effort.
      Our contracts module will speed up your quotation process. You can track enquiries and quotations on the
      dashboard and monitor open quotes.</p>

    <h4>Email your quotations directly to your customers from Fraction ERP, saving you time.</h4>
    <p>Once you have your quote ready to go, send it directly from our cloud ERP system. Just click on the email
      button, edit the email if you wish and send it off.</p>

    <h4>Sales order processing, made easy</h4>
    <p>Convert your quotes to sales orders with no fuss. Just update your quote to a sales order in the contracts
